# Road-Accident-Analysis
On Microsoft Excel
# Objective
### To analyze the road accident dataset from Kaggle using Microsoft Excel, with the aim of identifying key trends and patterns that contribute to road accidents. The project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard that visually represents these findings, providing valuable insights to enhance road safety strategies. This work is intended to serve as a resource for researchers, policymakers, and safety advocates, enabling data-driven decision-making.

### I recently conducted an in-depth analysis of a road accident dataset sourced from Kaggle, using Microsoft Excel to uncover key insights and trends. By leveraging my expertise in data analysis, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to identify significant patterns related to accident frequency, causes, and outcomes. The culmination of this project is an interactive dashboard created in Excel, which presents these findings in a clear and accessible format. This dashboard is designed to aid stakeholders in making informed decisions to improve road safety measures. The full analysis, along with the dashboard, has been uploaded to my GitHub repository for public access and further exploration.
